/******************************************************************************
 * AudioGraph Multi-Worker Race Condition Test
 * 
 * This test specifically targets the original race condition in the AudioGraph
 * engine where the audio thread and worker threads both called rb_pop_sc() to 
 * get work from the ready queue. This would cause:
 *
 * 1. Job duplication (same node processed twice)  
 * 2. Job loss (nodes skipped entirely)
 * 3. Inconsistent audio output
 * 4. Potential crashes from concurrent access
 *
 * The test creates a complex graph with many nodes and processes it using
 * process_block_parallel() with multiple worker threads while monitoring
 * for these exact failure modes.
